<p> Creating a program that can play a game comes down to carefully considering all the possible situations the AI can be in and 
how it should respond in each of those situations. The <b>Tic-Tac-Toe AI</b> is simple because there are not many possible moves in Tic-Tac-Toe 
as compared to a game like chess or checkers.<br>

Our AI checks if any possible move can allow itself to win. 
Otherwise, it checks if it must block the playerâ€™s move. 
Then the AI simply chooses any available corner space, then the center space, then the side spaces. 
This is a simple algorithm for the computer to follow.</br>
The key to implementing our AI is by making copies of the board data and simulating moves on the copy. 
That way, the AI code can see if a move results in a win or loss. Then the AI can make that move on the real board. 
This type of simulation is effective at predicting that is it a good move or not.</br>
