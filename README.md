# Tic_Tac_Toe AI-based Python Game

Tic-Tac-Toe in which the human mind play against AI(Artificial Intelligence).
```
  AI is a computer program that will respond intelligently to the player's every move.
```
The game doesnâ€™t introduce any complicated new concepts. Written code for AI is just a few lines of code. It makes use of our existing programming knowledge to make an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe player.
A Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game that can be played using pen and paper where 1 player mark X and the other player mark O. Players take their turns by placing X or O simultaneously. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column, or one of the two diagonals, he will win. When the board fills up with neither any of the lines, the game ends with a draw. The player makes their move by entering the number of the space they want to go. These numbers are in the same places as the number keys on your keyboard's keypad.
