# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-python-using-AI
It is a TIC-TAC-TOE game against a simple Artificial Intelligence. An artificial intelligence (or AI) is a computer program that can intelligently respond to the player’s moves. This game doesn’t introduce any complicated new concepts. The artificial intelligence that plays Tic-Tac-Toe is really just a few lines of code.It makes use of our existing programming knowledge to make an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe player. Two people play Tic-Tac-Toe with paper and pencil. One player is X and the other player is O. Players take turns placing their X or O. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column or one of the two diagonals, they win. When the board fills up with neither player winning, the game ends in a draw. The player makes their move by entering the number of the space they want to go. These numbers are in the same places as the number keys on your keyboard's keypad.
