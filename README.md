The game doesnâ€™t introduce any complicated new concepts. Written code for AI is really just a few lines of code. It makes use of our existing programming knowledge to make an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe player.
A Tic-Tac-Toe is two player game which can be played using pen and paper where 1 player mark X and the other player mark O. Players take their turns by placing X or O simultaneously. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column or one of the two diagonals, he will win. When the board fills up with neither any of the line, the game ends with a draw. The player makes their move by entering the number of the space they want to go. These numbers are in the same places as the number keys on your keyboard's keypad.
